# Vanilla js project set up

Not meant as an npm module, so in package.json there's no `main`.

Setup with eslint and prettier for linting and formatting, webpack as a module bundler and jest for tests.

The folder with Webpack generated files are put in .gitignore, so that only the source files are committed.
