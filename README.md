# Vanilla js project set up

Not meant as an npm module, so in package.json there's no `main`.

Setup with eslint and prettier for linting and formatting, webpack as a module bundler and jest for tests. Prettier works on save via VS Code extension.

The folder with Webpack generated files are put in .gitignore, so that only the source files are committed.
